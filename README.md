Place to show some examples of RobotC for FTC and FLL off-season programming examples.

## Dir Structure

This project has the following directory structure to facilitate 2 goals. The first goal is to be a seed repository of useful programs and examples to teach both mentors and students how to use RobotC on the Lego NXT.   The second goal is to fork this repository from xjschwen to WhitmoreLakeRobotics github account to serve as the git repository for the off-season workshops.
